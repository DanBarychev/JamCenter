# JamCenter

### About

JamCenter changes the way that musicians organize, share, and participate in jam sessions. Through a system of digital sessions, users can invite other musicians to their own sessions and look for other sessions in their area. By creating a session, a user can record audio, publish a song-list, and even share the session through Facebook. All sessions, by default, will become inactive one day after they begin.

### Finding Sessions

In the CurrentSessions page, you will see a list of currently active sessions in your location. By selecting one of these sessions, you are given detailed information on items such as exact location and other participants. These sessions will be gone one day after their listed start times.
