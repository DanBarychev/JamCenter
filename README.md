# JamCenter

### About

JamCenter changes the way that musicians organize, share, and participate in jam sessions. Through a system of digital sessions, users can invite other musicians to their own sessions and look for other sessions in their area. By creating a session, a user can record audio, publish a song-list, and even share the session through Facebook. All sessions, by default, will become inactive one day after they begin.

### Finding Sessions

In the CurrentSessions page, you will see a list of currently active sessions in your location. By selecting one of these sessions, you are given detailed information on items such as exact location and other participants. If you have already been invited to the session, you can join immediately. If not, you will need to enter a code given by the session host. Remember that these sessions, like all others, will be gone one day after their listed start times.

### Session Invitations

On the Invitations page, you will see a list of invitations that you have been given in order to join other users' sessions. By selecting an invitation, a user can immediately join a session and begin viewing media
